# realsimple-theme [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/realsimple-theme.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/realsimple-theme)


* Realsimple is a clean, simple, (mostly) one page theme for Jekyll. Post links navigate away from the main page, but all other navigation uses fullpage.js.

#### Note: this gem is *not* supported by GitHub Pages. If you would like to use this theme with GitHub Pages, you can clone the repository here: https://github.com/suzmas/suzmas.github.io and change the configuration as needed.

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "realsimple-theme"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: realsimple-theme
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install realsimple-theme

## Usage
Your config.yaml file should include definitions for author, author_title, twitter_url, linkedin_url, and github_url in order for the homepage links to work correctly.

Available layouts: default, default-nofp, home, page, post. Default uses the fullpage.js wrapper, while default-nofp does not.

The homepage layout cycles through your site's files that use the 'page' layout in the order they are organized in your directory- and creates a section on the homepage to display their content. The last section of the homepage displays links and snippets of your recent posts.

Files defined with layout 'post' use the 'default-nofp' layout by default.

### Fullpage.js Settings

You'll need to define 'page_str:' in the front-matter of all files using the page layout- page strings should follow the format of Fullpage.js section links--> firstPage, secondPage, 3rdpage, 4thpage. See https://github.com/suzmas/realsimple-theme/tree/master/example for an example.

Fullpage.js is initialized with four sections for a landing section, about section, portfolio section, and posts section. To set up this navigation style, add "page_str: secondPage" to the About.md front-matter. Create a file with title "Portfolio" and add "page_str: 3rdpage". The post snippets page is the last section by default.

If you add additional files that use the 'page' layout, you'll need to create an _assets folder with a file called fullpg.js and modify the 'anchors' settings. You can see an example of fullpage.js setup for this theme at: https://github.com/suzmas/realsimple-theme/tree/master/example. You can read about Fullpage.js options here: https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/

#### FYI, I'm in the process of configuring the theme to make Fullpagejs easier to use.
