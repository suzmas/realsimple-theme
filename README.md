# realsimple-theme

* Realsimple is a clean, simple, (mostly) one page theme for Jekyll. Post links navigate away from the main page, but all other navigation uses fullpage.js.


## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "realsimple-theme"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: realsimple-theme
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install realsimple-theme

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here. Describe your available layouts, includes, and/or sass.

Available layouts: default, default-nofp, home, page, post. Default uses the fullpage.js wrapper, while default-nofp does not.
